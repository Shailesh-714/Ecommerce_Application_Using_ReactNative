The Pilgrim 24K Gold Serum is an innovative formulation that can be used in skincare & make-up routines. The water-based serum is absorbed quickly into the skin, making it visibly bright, calm, & plump. Expertly crafted with radiance-inducing Gold leaf and skin-enhancing ingredients like Mulberry extract, Niacinamide & Hyaluronic acid, the serum brightens and gives the skin a youthful glow. The ultrafine Gold particles provide a luminous sheen and visibly reduce redness. They promote the production of collagen and microcirculation, keeping the skin firm & healthy. Shields against sun damage to prevent photoaging. Mulberry is a rich source of Vitamin C and antioxidative phytonutrients that brighten and protect the skin. Niacinamide strengthens the skin barrier function, reduces the appearance of pores, and regulates sebum production. So, it reduces breakouts and helps the skin remain free from blemishes. Hyaluronic Acid is a skincare superhero that deeply hydrates and fills out fine lines & wrinkles. It pulls in moisture to plump up the skin. The resultant high saturation of water just beneath the surface creates the "Glass Skin" effect that is all about that healthy, reflective glow. The versatile serum can be used before applying heavier complexion products for a smooth, crease-free, and dewy finish. Use it as a make-up primer to get the beautiful "Glass-Skin" effect now!
